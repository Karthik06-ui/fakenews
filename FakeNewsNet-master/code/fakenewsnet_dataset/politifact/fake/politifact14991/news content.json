A native-born family, the Bordens ran a mill in what became the town for generations before and after the American revolution. Industrialization began when Col. Joseph Durfee, a native-born Revolutionary War hero built the first factory in 1811. Later, at the end of the 19th Century a wave of immigrants swelled the town\u2019s population. Immigrants, however, never made up a majority of the population of Bristol County, where Fall River lies, even at their early 20th Century peak.", "images": ["https://media.breitbart.com/media/2026/01/Minneapolis-protest-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2026/01/mollyringwald-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2026/01/OpenAI-chief-Sam-Altman-criticizes-ICE-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/10/Meeting-with-Zelensky-Trump-Others-200x150.jpeg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2026/01/Wuhan-Institute-of-Virology-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2026/01/Jan27-2026-Ilhan-Omar-D-MN-getty-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2026/01/GiancarloEsposito-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2026/01/AP26021005718957-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2026/01/Mark-Zuckerberg-and-Donald-Trump-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2026/01/ALBERTO-PIZZOLI_AFP-via-Getty-Images-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2026/01/GettyImages2227083322-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2026/01/GettyImages-2232255558-200x150.png", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2026/01/IMG_5600-200x150.jpeg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2026/01/jan27-26-Minnesota-angry-justice-for-Alex-Pretti-protest-getty-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2026/01/Harry-How_Getty-Images-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2026/01/melania-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2026/01/Tom-Homan-White-House-border-czar-Jan2026-getty-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/10/Murphy-1016-Thumbnail-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1-640x480.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2026/01/ladygaga-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2026/01/GettyImages-2258715447-200x150.png", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2026/01/giancarlo-esposito-gus-fring_version-200x150.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ian Mason"], "canonical_link": "https://www.breitbart.com/live/state-union-fact-check-analysis-livewire/fact-check-no-falls-river-massachusetts-was-not-built-by-immigrants/", "title": "Fact-Check: No, Fall River, Massachusetts, Was Not \u2018Built by Immigrants\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=722987199", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.breitbart.app", "theme-color": "#FF5500", "ahrefs-site-verification": "e5213d6c4a07fe85baa34006f2a9a3c977bd8f3a50fd0ab6d2aa93844e0b3303", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Rep.
