These repositories preserve and provide public access to these historical materials.\n\nIn the 1930s, a dramatic increase in the volume of Presidential papers led President Franklin D. Roosevelt to seek the advice of historians and others on how and where to keep his White House files, earlier papers, his book collection and key memorabilia. At that time, all of the White House papers of a President of the United States were deemed to be the President's personal property.\n\nRoosevelt announced plans for a new type of facility to house these papers and materials on December 10, 1938. An organization was chartered to raise private funds for the construction of the building on Roosevelt's Hyde Park, New York estate.\n\nOn July 18, 1939 Congress passed a joint resolution accepting the new facility and agreeing to operate it as part of the National Archives. The Roosevelt Library was dedicated on June 30, 1941.\n\nThe Roosevelt Library became a model for many subsequent Presidential Libraries.\n\nThe Presidential Libraries Act of 1955 allowed for the Archivist of the United States to designate a presidential archival depository at a site chosen by a President of the United States after his term in office. This archival depository consists of the archival contents ---documents, files, films, videos, tapes, etc.--- of the presidency. The Act also established the public/private partnership between the U.S. government and nonprofit presidential foundations to preserve and make available the contents of presidential archives.\n\nIn a literal sense, this archive is a Presidential Library.\n\nOver time, the term \"Presidential Library\" has come to describe entire facilities, museums and campuses dedicated to the history and legacy of a president, and some are called presidential centers. The National Archives' role at each of these sites varies. Today most Presidential Archival Depositories are co-located with broader campuses that include museums, gardens, event spaces, etc. and many Presidents and First Ladies have chosen these sites as their final resting places.\n\nLearn more about the history of the Presidential Libraries.\n\nWhat institutions comprise the Presidential Library System administered by NARA?\n\nThe Presidential Library System comprises 16 Presidential Libraries documenting Presidents Herbert Hoover through Joseph R. Biden Jr.\n\nWhen are the records of a former President open for research?\n\nFor older Presidential Libraries (Hoover through Carter, with the exception of Nixon), access to the holdings are governed by deeds of gift, and the papers are processed according to prioritized plans developed by each Library. Major areas of current research interest and the timeliness of topics in the national arena are also considered. Nixon Presidential materials are governed by the Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act (PRMPA), and material is reviewed in accordance with established regulations.\n\nFor newer Libraries (from Reagan forward), the holdings are governed by the Presidential Records Act (PRA) of 1978. Under the PRA, the records are exempt from public release for five years after the end of a Presidential administration. During this five-year period, archivists begin processing and preparing materials for release to researchers.\n\nAfter the end of the five-year period, all Presidential records become subject to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. These requests must be made in writing and cite the Freedom of Information Act and then be submitted to the appropriate Library by mail, e-mail, fax, or in person.\n\nThe Libraries whose Presidential holdings are governed by the PRA work to respond to FOIA requests from the general public. They process records and make them publicly available not only to requestors but also to anyone interested in conducting research on the particular topics covered by FOIA requests.\n\nLearn more available about requesting access to records.\n\nHow can a researcher find out what records are open at a Presidential Library?\n\nEach Presidential Library has digitized a portion of their textual and audiovisual collections and made them available on their websites.\n\nThe Presidential Daily Diary is the official record of the presidents\u2019 travel, meetings, and telephone calls. View all of the digitized Presidential Daily Diaries from Roosevelt onward.\n\nResearchers can search archival records through the National Archives Catalog.\n\nIn addition, each Library also has a website that contains information regarding their holdings including finding aids and collection guides. If finding aids are not available online, researchers can contact the Library, for more information on the materials available for research.\n\nMuseum Information\n\nAre the museums of the Presidential Libraries open to the general public?\n\nPresidential Libraries and Museums with permanent facilities are open to the general public of all ages. NARA's Presidential Museums document the life and times of its respective President.\n\nEach Presidential Museum charges an admission fee, with revenues going to support museum operations and programs.\n\nThe museums also host changing exhibits about particular topics relating to American history and the American experience and are open to the public year-round.\n\nMany Libraries also have an active education component, providing programs geared specifically to students and teachers and often tied to local curricula.\n\nHow many people visit the Presidential Library Museums?\n\nBelow is the count of visitors to the museum at the Presidential Libraries from the past 5 fiscal years. The federal government's fiscal year runs from October 1-September 30.\n\nLibrary Fiscal Year 2020* Fiscal Year 2021* Fiscal Year 2022 Fiscal Year 2023 Fiscal Year 2024 Herbert Hoover Presidential Library and Museum 8,235 2,216 18,983 24,726 25,316 Franklin D.

Bush Presidential Library, as well as the volunteer program, officially transferred from NARA to the George W. Bush Foundation on January 1, 2023.\n\nPassport to Presidential Libraries Program\n\nWhat is the Passport Program?\n\nThrough the Passport to Presidential Libraries program, visitors can purchase a special keepsake booklet to take with them on their travels to Presidential Libraries across the nation. Visitors receive a commemorative stamp from the Library at the time of the purchase and can collect stamps from every Presidential Library visited in the future. Once they collect stamps from all Presidential Libraries, they may visit any of the Presidential Libraries for a special gift.\n\nHow do I get my Passport stamped?\n\nStamps are available at each Library's admissions desk and/or museum store. We unfortunately cannot retroactively stamp Passports or accept Passports via mail for stamping purposes.\n\nWho can I call with questions about the Passport?\n\nPlease direct all inquiries and feedback regarding the Passport to Presidential Libraries to the Office of Presidential Libraries at (301) 837-3250.\n\nFunding\n\nHow is a Presidential Library funded?\n\nA Presidential Library is constructed with private or non-Federal funds donated to non-profit organizations typically established by the former President for the express purpose of building a Presidential Library and supporting its programs.\n\nSome Libraries have also received construction and development funding from state and/or local governments or university partners.\n\nTraditionally, these facilities have then been transferred to the Federal Government to be operated and maintained by NARA, through its congressionally appropriated operating budget. Over the last several decades \u2013in recognition of the rising costs associated with maintaining Presidential Libraries\u2013 various efforts have been undertaken to save taxpayer funds while sustaining the Presidential Library system.\n\nWhat is the role of a Presidential Library foundation?\n\nPresidential Foundations are traditionally NARA\u2019s partners in the joint operation of presidential library campuses, embracing public/private partnerships.\n\nWhile NARA\u2019s statutory mission is to preserve and facilitate access to the presidential records and artifacts of an administration, many Presidential Foundations operate event centers, education centers, public programs and gift shops at the library sites. Others provide financial support to NARA for maintenance and operations, digitization of presidential collections and programming, contributing to the sustainability of library sites.\n\nIn several cases, these organizations evolved from bodies chartered to raise money and construct the original Library building. In other instances, these organizations were formed after the dedication of the Library by friends of the President.\n\nStatutorily, beginning with President George H.W. Bush, Presidential Foundations that elect to fund a NARA facility must provide a financial endowment to NARA to help offset facility operating and maintenance expenses.\n\nHow do taxpayers support Presidential Libraries?\n\nNARA\u2019s mission is to preserve and make available the records of the United States Government. Presidential Libraries support this mission by preserving and providing access to materials from the Executive Office of the President. The papers and records created by, for, or about Presidents, Vice Presidents, and their administrations document the key decisions, policy and activities of the institution of the Presidency. The documents and artifacts held by the Presidential Libraries not only inform society about the President as an individual and about his term in office, but also provide insights into the American experience.\n\nNARA provides access to these holdings through research rooms, and through its contributions to exhibitions across the United States and the world.\n\nBuilding Details\n\nDoes NARA have any input into the decision on location or the kind of building the Presidential Library will be?\n\nThe former President or his representatives choose the architects, or an architectural firm/design team for the building of a Presidential Library and for the development and fabrication of museum exhibits. The President or his representatives are solely responsible for choice of the final location for the Library building and for the construction costs.\n\nApplicable if the building will be donated to the United States Government: The Presidential Libraries Act (44 U.S.C. Section 2112 (a) (2)) requires the Archivist of the United States to establish architectural and design standards that apply to new and existing libraries \u201cin order to ensure that such depositories (A) preserve Presidential records subject to Chapter 22 of 44 U.S.C. and papers and other historical materials accepted for deposit under section 2111 of 44 U.S.C. (B) contain adequate research facilities.\u201d The Architectural and Design Standards for Presidential Libraries are a supplement to NARA directive 1571, Archival Storage Standards, and NARA provides the standards for Presidential Libraries to the architects and design team selected by the former President or his representatives.\n\nView the current Architecture and Design Standards for Presidential Libraries.\n\nAre there any limits to the size of Presidential Library buildings that are donated to the United States Government?\n\nThough not specifically limiting the size of Presidential Libraries, the Presidential Libraries Act of 1986 mandates that Presidential Foundations must provide a financial endowment to NARA upon acceptance of the Library facility by the Archivist of the United States to contribute to operations and maintenance expenses. The size of this endowment is based in part on the size of the facility and this resulted in the practical effect of limiting the size of newer Libraries.\n\nBuilding size requirements under the Presidential Libraries Act would not be applicable to privately-constructed Presidential Libraries or Centers that are not donated to the United States Government.\n\nHow big are the Presidential Libraries?\n\nThe Presidential Libraries are most often buildings or series of buildings managed by the National Archives and Records Administration and the Presidential Foundation.\n\nBelow are the size of the buildings under the management of the National Archives and Records Administration. This data is provided by the General Services Administration in their Federal Real Property Profile and will be updated accordingly.\n\nLibrary Square Feet Herbert Hoover Presidential Library and Museum 47,169 s.f.

This rich resource of audiovisual materials may include home movies, official White House photographs, and audiotapes of Presidential conversations.\n\nModern Presidential Libraries are also the custodians of the electronic records generated by a Presidential administration in its carrying out constitutional, statutory, and ceremonial duties of the Presidency.\n\nAdditionally, a Presidential Library contains thousands of artifacts from his life, career and presidency. Whether a gift from a foreign head of state or a cherished childhood memento, the artifacts provide a unique record of a President's life, in and out of the public eye.\n\nWhere are the materials of Presidents before Herbert Hoover?\n\nAlthough Franklin D. Roosevelt established the first Presidential Library, his predecessor, Herbert Hoover, later established a Presidential Library in West Branch, Iowa.\n\nThe materials of Presidents prior to Herbert Hoover are dispersed throughout the nation. Some are held by universities and historical societies, but a large quantity are held by the Library of Congress. The Other Places to Research Presidential Materials page is an excellent starting point to finding information on other presidents.\n\nThe extent of Presidential materials in archival and historical institutions across the country varies considerably.\n\nHow many records do all the Presidential Libraries hold and how many of those are open to researchers?\n\nBelow are the holding counts for each of the Presidential Libraries as of 2022. Please note that collections change over time as new donations are added; those changes will be updated on this page.\n\nLibrary Textual records Electronic Records Non-Textual Audio-Visual Records Artifacts Herbert Hoover Presidential Library and Museum 6,050 cubic feet N/A 268 cubic feet 15,641 artifacts Franklin D.

The percentage of materials processed at the individual Libraries tend to follow a chronological trend.\n\nRecords that are processed and available to researchers are deemed \u201copen.\u201d The older Libraries (Hoover, Roosevelt, and Truman) each have processed more than 90% of their holdings; the middle Libraries (Eisenhower through Carter) have each processed more than half their holdings; and the most recent Libraries (from Reagan forward) have processed less than 50% of their holdings.\n\nWhat are the key statutes governing the establishment and operation of a Presidential Library?\n\nThough Congress approved the acceptance of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum by the National Archives in 1939, the nation's legislative branch did not formally authorize the Presidential Library System until 1955 with the passage of the Presidential Libraries Act.\n\nThe Presidential Libraries Act of 1955 codified the acceptance, in the name of the United States, of land, buildings, and equipment for the purposes of creating a Presidential archival depository, as well as the role of the National Archives in maintaining, operating, and protecting them as a Presidential archival depository.\n\nThe act was amended in 1986, encouraging a limit of 70,000 square feet for the Presidential Library facility that will be provided to the government and establishing a requirement for an endowment to help offset the maintenance and operations costs of the facility. The standard endowment percentage was set at 20 percent and has increased over time. The most recent legislative update concerning presidential library endowments set the endowment requirement for future Presidential Libraries that are donated to the government at 60 percent of the overall initial cost of the facility.\n\nWhat is a deed of gift?\n\nA deed of gift is a legal document between a donor and an archival repository to give items or collections to that repository.\n\nPrior to the passage of the Presidential Records Act in 1978, the documentary materials created by a President and his staff during a presidential administration were considered the President's personal property.\n\nMany Presidents prior to the Presidential Records Act of 1978 donated their Presidential papers to NARA through deed of gift agreements.\n\nWhat is the Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act?\n\nCongress passed the Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act (PRMPA) in 1974. PRMPA transferred ownership of the Presidential historical materials of President Richard Nixon to the Federal Government, deposited them with the National Archives, and specified access restrictions to these materials. This law challenged the longstanding presumption that a President\u2019s papers and materials were his personal property.\n\nThe Act also called for a commission to study and make recommendations regarding the status of the papers of all Federal officials, including those of the President. The findings of this study led to the Presidential Records Act of 1978, vesting ownership of the official records of the President and Vice President with the Federal Government after January 20, 1981.", "images": ["https://www.archives.gov/sites/all/themes/nara/images/naralogo-og.png", "https://www.archives.gov/sites/all/themes/nara/images/nara-print-logo.jpg", "https://www.archives.gov/files/a250/freedom-250.svg", "https://www.archives.gov/files/presidential-libraries/images/1929-inaugural.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.archives.gov/sites/all/themes/nara/images/naralogo-og.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.archives.gov/presidential-libraries/about/frequently-asked-questions", "title": "Frequently Asked Questions", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "description": "History What is a Presidential Library?
