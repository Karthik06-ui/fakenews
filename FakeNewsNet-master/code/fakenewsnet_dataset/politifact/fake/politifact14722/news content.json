His page also featured photos of several high powered weapons.\n\nHis Facebook page was taken down without explanation less than an hour after the shooting.\n\nAn eyewitness told CBS News that there was a heavy police presence on the road to the church, adding that they had seen severely injured people being airlifted from the area.\n\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott posted to Twitter shortly after the mass shooting, saying: \u201cOur prayers are with all who were harmed by this evil act. Our thanks to law enforcement for their response. More details from DPS soon.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump has confirmed he is aware of the situation and said he was monitoring it from Japan.\n\nSource: YourNewsWire", "images":
