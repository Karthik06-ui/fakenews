Using this search form, we collected data on the 10 most common causes of death for African-American men and boys between the ages of 15 and 24, for 2014.\n\nRank\n\nCause of death\n\nNumber of deaths\n\nNumber gun-related\n\n1st\n\nHomicide\n\n2,416\n\n2,256\n\n2nd\n\nUnintentional injuries\n\n1,135\n\n47\n\n3rd\n\nSuicide\n\n448\n\n230\n\n4th\n\nHeart disease\n\n172\n\n--\n\n5th\n\nCancer\n\n161\n\n--\n\n6th\n\nHIV\n\n52\n\n--\n\n7th\n\nChronic lower respiratory diseases\n\n47\n\n--\n\n8th\n\nCongenital anomalies\n\n38\n\n--\n\n9th\n\nAnemia\n\n33\n\n--\n\n10th\n\nDiabetes\n\n33\n\n--\n\nTotal, 2nd through 9th place\n\n--\n\n2,119\n\n--\n\nSo even if you look only at gun-related homicides, there were 2,256 of those in 2014, compared to 2,119 deaths in the next nine categories combined. This makes Clinton\u2019s statement correct.\n\nIf you add in the accidents and suicides related to guns, the gap between gun-related deaths and other types of deaths expands even further.\n\nThere were 2,533 gun-related deaths in all 10 categories combined, compared to 2,002 deaths in the top 10 categories that had nothing to do with guns.\n\nWe should note that this statement is dependent on the age range chosen. For instance, the statement is not correct for African-American boys between age 10 and 14. There were 38 gun-related homicides in that age and racial group in 2014, plus 10 gun suicides and three unintentional injuries caused by guns, for a total of 51. By contrast, the top 10 causes of death for that age and racial group included 271 deaths that had nothing to do with guns, such as diseases.\n\nThat said, we think Clinton\u2019s definition of \"young\" as 15-24 is a reasonable one.\n\nOur ruling\n\nClinton said, \"Gun violence is by far the leading cause of death for young African-American men, outstripping the next nine causes of death combined.\"\n\nAs long as you define \"young\" as being between the ages of 15 and 24, Clinton\u2019s statement is accurate, according to CDC data. We rate the statement True.", "images": ["https://static.politifact.com/CACHE/images/politifact/mugs/new_djt_mugshot/c1c32c5a2e0a94447f75d2e6dfe5573d.jpg",
